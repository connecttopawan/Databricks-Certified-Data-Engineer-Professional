81. **Scenario**: A streaming job fails due to a temporary network issue. How would you ensure it resumes correctly?

    **Answer**: Use checkpointing and retry logic.

    **Explanation**: Configure checkpointing with `writeStream.checkpointLocation` to track progress. Implement retry logic in the job using try-catch blocks or workflow retries to handle transient errors.

82. **Scenario**: A Delta table becomes inconsistent after a failed merge operation. How would you recover?

    **Answer**: Revert to a previous version using time travel.

    **Explanation**: Use `DESCRIBE HISTORY` to find the last consistent version. Run `RESTORE TABLE TO VERSION AS OF` to revert the table, then reapply the merge with corrected logic.

83. **Scenario**: A job fails due to a null pointer exception in a UDF. How would you debug and fix it?

    **Answer**: Add null checks and log errors in the UDF.

    **Explanation**: Modify the UDF to handle null inputs explicitly (e.g., `if input is None`). Add logging to capture error details. Test the UDF on a small dataset to identify issues.

84. **Scenario**: A pipeline fails due to a missing Python dependency. How would you resolve it?

    **Answer**: Install the dependency via an init script or `%pip`.

    **Explanation**: Use a cluster init script to install the dependency during startup. Alternatively, run `%pip install <library>` in a notebook and restart the cluster to apply changes.

85. **Scenario**: A job fails due to out-of-memory errors during a large join. How would you handle this?

    **Answer**: Broadcast smaller tables and increase memory.

    **Explanation**: Use `broadcast()` for smaller tables to reduce shuffle. Increase executor memory with `spark.executor.memory` and enable AQE to optimize join plans dynamically.

86. **Scenario**: A streaming job fails due to an invalid schema in incoming data. How would you handle this?

    **Answer**: Use schema validation and divert invalid records.

    **Explanation**: Define an explicit schema and use `spark.readStream.schema()`. Divert invalid records to `badRecordsPath` and log them to a Delta table for analysis.

87. **Scenario**: A pipeline fails due to a race condition in concurrent writes. How would you prevent this?

    **Answer**: Use Delta Lake’s optimistic concurrency control.

    **Explanation**: Delta Lake handles concurrent writes with optimistic concurrency. Ensure unique keys in `merge` operations to avoid conflicts. Monitor `DESCRIBE HISTORY` for conflicts.

88. **Scenario**: A job fails due to a timeout in a REST API call. How would you handle this?

    **Answer**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

    **Explanation**: Use a library like `requests` with retry logic (e.g., `tenacity`) to handle timeouts. Configure exponential backoff to retry failed API calls gracefully.

89. **Scenario**: A pipeline fails due to a corrupted Parquet file. How would you identify and fix it?

    **Answer**: Use `corruptRecordPath` and reprocess valid data.

    **Explanation**: Read the Parquet file with `spark.read.option("corruptRecordPath", "/path")` to isolate corrupt records. Identify and remove the corrupted file, then reprocess the valid data.

90. **Scenario**: A job fails due to a Spark configuration issue. How would you diagnose it?

    **Answer**: Check Spark logs and use the Spark UI.

    **Explanation**: Review Spark logs in the Databricks Cluster UI for configuration errors. Use the Spark UI to analyze job stages and identify misconfigured settings (e.g., `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`).

## Scalability and Cost Optimization

91. **Scenario**: A cluster is over-provisioned, leading to high costs. How would you optimize resource usage?

    **Answer**: Enable auto-scaling and use spot instances.

    **Explanation**: Configure auto-scaling to adjust cluster size based on workload. Use spot instances for non-critical jobs to reduce costs, with fallback to on-demand instances for reliability.

92. **Scenario**: A job processes a large dataset but only needs a few columns. How would you optimize it?

    **Answer**: Use column pruning and predicate pushdown.

    **Explanation**: Select only required columns in the query to reduce data read. Apply filters early to leverage predicate pushdown, minimizing data scanned by Spark.

93. **Scenario**: A nightly batch job incurs high compute costs. How would you reduce costs?

    **Answer**: Use a job cluster with auto-termination and spot instances.

    **Explanation**: Create a job-specific cluster that terminates after completion. Use spot instances and auto-scaling to minimize costs while maintaining performance.

94. **Scenario**: A streaming job processes high-velocity data, causing high costs. How would you optimize it?

    **Answer**: Tune micro-batch size and use Delta Lake.

    **Explanation**: Adjust `maxOffsetsPerTrigger` to control micro-batch size. Use Delta Lake for efficient writes and checkpointing to reduce storage and compute costs.

95. **Scenario**: A pipeline processes data across regions, incurring high data transfer costs. How would you minimize this?

    **Answer**: Co-locate compute and storage in the same region.

    **Explanation**: Deploy clusters in the same region as the data storage (e.g., S3, ADLS). Use Delta caching to minimize cross-region reads, reducing transfer costs.

96. **Scenario**: A job processes a large dataset but queries only recent data. How would you optimize storage?

    **Answer**: Partition by date and use `VACUUM`.

    **Explanation**: Partition the Delta table by date to optimize recent data queries. Run `VACUUM` with a retention period to delete old files, reducing storage costs.

97. **Scenario**: A pipeline uses excessive compute resources due to inefficient joins. How would you optimize it?

    **Answer**: Use broadcast joins and co-partition tables.

    **Explanation**: Broadcast smaller tables to avoid shuffling. Partition tables on join keys to enable co-located joins, reducing data movement and compute usage.

98. **Scenario**: A job runs slowly due to small file sizes in a Delta table. How would you optimize it?

    **Answer**: Run `OPTIMIZE` and enable auto-compaction.

    **Explanation**: Use `OPTIMIZE` to compact small files. Enable auto-compaction (`delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite=true`) to maintain optimal file sizes during writes.

99. **Scenario**: A pipeline processes data incrementally but requires occasional full refreshes. How would you manage this?

    **Answer**: Use parameterized notebooks and Delta `overwrite`.

    **Explanation**: Create a notebook with parameters for incremental or full processing. Use `write.mode("overwrite")` for full refreshes and `merge` for incremental updates, ensuring consistency.

100. **Scenario**: A pipeline runs on a shared cluster, causing resource contention. How would you optimize resource allocation?

     **Answer**: Use job-specific clusters and pool resources.

     **Explanation**: Create dedicated job clusters to isolate workloads. Use instance pools to pre-warm nodes, reducing startup time and ensuring efficient resource allocation.
