## Question 1
You are designing a Delta Lake table to store customer data with strict data quality requirements. The table must prevent the insertion of records with missing or invalid customer IDs. Which approach ensures this requirement is met?

A. Use a CHECK constraint to enforce non-null customer IDs.  
B. Set the configuration `delta.enforceSchema = true`.  
C. Use a MERGE statement with a conditional insert.  
D. Apply a schema inference mechanism during table creation.  
E. Use a VACUUM operation to remove invalid records.

**Answer**: A  
**Explanation**: Delta Lake supports CHECK constraints to enforce data quality rules, such as ensuring customer IDs are non-null or valid. For example, you can define a constraint like `CHECK (customer_id IS NOT NULL AND customer_id > 0)`. Option B (`delta.enforceSchema`) ensures schema compliance but doesn’t enforce specific data quality rules. Option C (MERGE) is useful for upserts but not for enforcing constraints on insert. Option D (schema inference) may allow invalid data if not explicitly validated. Option E (VACUUM) removes deleted data but doesn’t prevent invalid insertions.

## Question 2
A retail company uses Delta Lake to manage sales data. The data model requires a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 table to track historical changes in product prices. Which steps are necessary to implement this using Delta Lake?

A. Create a table with `start_date`, `end_date`, and `is_active` columns, and use MERGE to update records.  
B. Use schema inference to automatically handle price changes.  
C. Overwrite the table with each price update to maintain history.  
D. Use a CHECK constraint to enforce unique product IDs.  
E. Set `delta.deduplicate = true` to avoid duplicate price records.

**Answer**: A  
**Explanation**: SCD Type 2 requires maintaining historical records by adding columns like `start_date`, `end_date`, and `is_active` to track the validity of each record. A MERGE statement can be used to insert new records and update existing ones (e.g., setting `end_date` and `is_active` for outdated records). Option B (schema inference) doesn’t manage historical tracking. Option C (overwrite) would lose historical data. Option D (CHECK constraint) ensures uniqueness but doesn’t handle history. Option E (`delta.deduplicate`) is not a valid Delta Lake configuration.

## Question 3
You are designing a data model for a healthcare application using Delta Lake. The model includes a patient table with highly nested JSON data. Only 30 of the 100 fields are currently used by downstream applications. What is the best approach for schema declaration?

A. Manually define all 100 fields in the schema to ensure data quality.  
B. Use schema inference to automatically detect all fields.  
C. Define only the 30 used fields and ignore the rest.  
D. Store the JSON as a single string column and parse it dynamically.  
E. Use a Parquet footer to modify unused fields dynamically.

**Answer**: A  
**Explanation**: Manually defining all 100 fields ensures strict schema enforcement and data quality, which is critical for healthcare applications. This approach prevents unexpected schema changes and allows Delta Lake to optimize storage and queries. Option B (schema inference) may introduce errors if data changes unexpectedly. Option C ignores unused fields, risking future compatibility issues. Option D (storing as a string) loses the benefits of structured data. Option E (Parquet footer) is not a practical approach for schema management in Delta Lake.

---

## Question 4
A Delta Lake table stores transaction data and must enforce uniqueness on the `transaction_id` column. Which approach ensures this requirement?

A. Use a PRIMARY KEY constraint.  
B. Apply a UNIQUE constraint on `transaction_id`.  
C. Use a MERGE statement with a deduplication condition.  
D. Set `delta.uniqueKeys = transaction_id`.  
E. Use Z-ordering on `transaction_id`.

**Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Delta Lake supports UNIQUE constraints to enforce uniqueness on columns like `transaction_id`. This ensures no duplicate values are inserted. Option A (PRIMARY KEY) is not supported in Delta Lake as of the current version. Option C (MERGE) can deduplicate during upserts but doesn’t enforce uniqueness on insert. Option D (`delta.uniqueKeys`) is not a valid configuration. Option E (Z-ordering) optimizes query performance but doesn’t enforce uniqueness.

---

## Question 5
You are tasked with designing a data pipeline that processes streaming sensor data into a Delta Lake table. The table must support incremental updates and prevent duplicate sensor readings. Which approach is most effective?

A. Use a full outer join to deduplicate data before writing.  
B. Perform an insert-only MERGE with a matching condition on a unique key.  
C. Set `delta.deduplicate = true` on the table.  
D. Use a CHECK constraint to reject duplicates.  
E. Overwrite the table with each batch to remove duplicates.

**Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: An insert-only MERGE with a matching condition on a unique key (e.g., `sensor_id` and `timestamp`) ensures that only new, non-duplicate records are inserted into the Delta Lake table. This is efficient for streaming data and maintains data integrity. Option A (full outer join) is computationally expensive and not ideal for streaming. Option C (`delta.deduplicate`) is not a valid configuration. Option D (CHECK constraint) cannot enforce deduplication across records. Option E (overwrite) is not suitable for incremental updates.

---

## Question 6
You are designing a data model for a retail company that requires lookup tables for product information. What are the trade-offs of using a normalized versus a denormalized data model in Delta Lake?

A. Normalized models reduce storage but increase query complexity; denormalized models simplify queries but increase storage.  
B. Normalized models improve query performance; denormalized models reduce data consistency.  
C. Normalized models simplify schema evolution; denormalized models improve data quality.  
D. Normalized models increase storage; denormalized models reduce query performance.  
E. Normalized models are not supported in Delta Lake.

**Answer**: A  
**Explanation**: Normalized models store data in separate tables, reducing redundancy and storage but requiring joins that increase query complexity. Denormalized models combine data into a single table, simplifying queries but increasing storage due to data duplication. Option B is incorrect because normalized models typically slow query performance due to joins. Option C is incorrect as normalized models complicate schema evolution. Option D reverses the storage and performance trade-offs. Option E is false as Delta Lake supports both models.

## Question 7
A Delta Lake table stores customer data with a composite key (`customer_id`, `region`). How can you enforce uniqueness on this composite key?

A. Use a CHECK constraint on both columns.  
B. Apply a UNIQUE constraint on (`customer_id`, `region`).  
C. Use a MERGE statement to deduplicate records.  
D. Set `delta.constraints.compositeKey = customer_id, region`.  
E. Use Z-ordering on the composite key.

**Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Delta Lake supports UNIQUE constraints on composite keys, such as (`customer_id`, `region`), to enforce uniqueness across multiple columns. Option A (CHECK constraint) is not designed for uniqueness enforcement. Option C (MERGE) can deduplicate but doesn’t enforce uniqueness on insert. Option D is not a valid Delta Lake configuration. Option E (Z-ordering) optimizes queries but doesn’t enforce uniqueness.

---

## Question 8
You are implementing a data model for a financial application using Delta Lake. The model must support ACID transactions and handle concurrent updates from multiple users. Which feature ensures data consistency?

A. Z-ordering  
B. Delta Lake’s transaction log  
C. Schema inference  
D. Parquet file format  
E. Auto Loader

**Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Delta Lake’s transaction log ensures ACID compliance by recording all operations (inserts, updates, deletes) and managing concurrent updates through optimistic concurrency control. This guarantees data consistency in multi-user environments. Option A (Z-ordering) optimizes query performance. Option C (schema inference) doesn’t handle concurrency. Option D (Parquet) is a storage format, not a concurrency mechanism. Option E (Auto Loader) is for data ingestion, not consistency.

---

## Question 9

A. Use a CHECK constraint on the `timestamp` column.  
B. Partition the table by `timestamp`.  
C. Set `delta.deduplicate = true`.  
D. Use schema inference for the `timestamp` column.  
E. Overwrite the table daily to maintain performance.

**Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Partitioning the table by `timestamp` (e.g., by date or hour) reduces the amount of data scanned during queries, improving performance for time-series data. Option A (CHECK constraint) enforces data quality but doesn’t optimize queries. Option C (`delta.deduplicate`) is not a valid configuration. Option D (schema inference) doesn’t impact query performance. Option E (overwrite) disrupts incremental updates and doesn’t optimize queries.

---

## Question 10
A Delta Lake table stores order data, and you need to implement an SCD Type 1 table to maintain only the latest order status. Which approach is most efficient?
